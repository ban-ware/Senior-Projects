Basically the objective of this project was to implement some security measures and some quality of life features into a web application / webserver we were provided with.

Some details about the application first, however.  The way that HTML is being served from the device is very clunky and overly complex. Basically there is an entire
webpage worth of code that has been gzipped, and to do any sort of testing or work, one must ungzip the code, edit it, re-gzip it, then place it back in the 
program and cross their fingers.

The first thing we decided to do was allow users to toggle the ability to use "pro" features, or the more complex features of the webcam.  After this,
we attempted to implement a login system.  We had a lot of trouble with this, as any encryption had to be in pure javascript.  This left us with few
succinct and timely options.  We ended up doing a simple implementation of a hashmap.  This worked in testing, but wouldn't function inside the script tag.

It's not a quality project by any means, but I learned a lot from it.  Much of this project was thinking on your feet and problem solving.


I hope that I never have to implement HTML in this way again.
