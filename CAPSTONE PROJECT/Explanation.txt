This is the big one.  I was part of a group of 3, with both of my group members being Computer Information Systems majors. 

The project was to implement a report interface into the web app of a local startup, PumpTrakr.

The goal of PumpTrakr was to automate irrigation systems for farmers.  Our reporting interface gave the option for users to view their overall fuel usage,
moisture availability, pump sessions, and gallons pumped. We also included a report for admins to view user activity.  

I will say, one of my group members got a job with PumpTrakr in QA, and happened to be an absolute monster when it came to programming.  This man wrote well over 2k lines
of code in just about 2 months.  I wish I could say I contributed more, but my role turned into bug-hunting, formatting, and restructuring.  Basically I took some of
the ideas that he implemented, and cleaned them up.  I ended up contributing +8 lines of code, but removed much more than that.

This project was incredibly fun, and I got to learn more about Full Stack engineering as well as SQL, Ruby, and Typescript. I had little to no experience with any of 
the technologies used, but now I feel comfortable with them, and have been working on a small project in Rust/Typescript using WASM.
