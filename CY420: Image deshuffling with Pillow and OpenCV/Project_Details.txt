    map.docx        #Map we created of individual indices of all 32 pieces of messed32
                    #Each block of 4 numbers corresponds to a piece of an         
                    image generated by detectlines.py and each pieces transformation.

    stitching.py    #Contains parts of detectlines.py that stitch 4 image pieces into 
                    a larger piece.  By entering values from the map into seperate  
                    arrays, we were able to stitch them into 8 larger images, 
                    then  stitch those 8 images into one image using Pillow.
