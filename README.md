This is just a few projects I completed my during my senior year of college.  
I primarily used Python and C. Two projects currently have their own repositories, pyVFMS and sonarduino.


Most code included here lacks comments because there were no grades for documentation, 
but I may try to add some documentation to explain what's going on with these projects.
